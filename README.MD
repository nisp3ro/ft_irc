## üåü Advanced Summary of This IRC Server

This IRC server is implemented in C++ following the standard IRC protocol (RFC 2812). It is designed to handle multiple client connections over IPv6 using non-blocking sockets and the `poll()` system call, ensuring efficient management of numerous simultaneous connections. The server‚Äôs architecture is highly modular, with each command (such as PASS, NICK, USER, JOIN, MODE, TOPIC, etc.) encapsulated in its own class derived from a common base `Command` class, which simplifies extension and maintenance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Server Workflow

1.  **üöÄ Startup and Initialization**
    *   **Main Function:**
        The program starts in the `main()` function, where command-line arguments are validated. The server requires two arguments: a port number (as a numeric value) and a password. Once validated, an instance of the `Server` class is created, and its `listen()` method is invoked.
    *   **Socket Setup:**
        The server sets up a master socket configured for IPv6 TCP connections, enabling non-blocking I/O through `fcntl()`. It binds to the specified port and then listens for incoming connections.
    *   **Signal Handling:**
        Signal handlers (for SIGINT to shutdown and SIGQUIT to toggle debug mode) are registered. These handlers set global flags so that the server can shut down gracefully or toggle debug output.
    *   **Polling for Activity:**
        The `poll()` system call is used to monitor the master socket and all connected client sockets. When an event is detected, the server either accepts a new connection or reads incoming data from an existing client.

2.  **üîó Connection Management**
    *   **Accepting Clients:**
        When a new connection is detected on the master socket, the server accepts it. The client‚Äôs IP address is processed (e.g., for IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses), and a new `Client` object is created.
    *   **Non-Blocking I/O and Dynamic Polling:**
        Each client's socket is added to a dynamically maintained array of file descriptors for polling, ensuring that all sockets are monitored for incoming data.
    *   **Graceful Shutdown:**
        When shutdown signals are received, the server stops accepting new connections and disconnects clients gracefully.

3.  **üí¨ Data Reception and Command Handling**
    *   **Receiving Data:**
        The server reads data from client sockets in a non-blocking manner. Data is buffered until a complete command (terminated by a newline) is received; incomplete messages are stored until additional data arrives.
    *   **Command Parsing and Execution:**
        Incoming messages are parsed into individual commands. The `CommandHandler` class maintains a mapping between command names (e.g., PASS, NICK, USER, JOIN, PART, MODE, TOPIC, KICK, PRIVMSG, NOTICE, WHO, LIST) and their corresponding command objects. It then validates the parameters, checks registration and permissions when necessary, and finally executes the command using the appropriate `execute()` method.

<details>
<summary>üõ†Ô∏è Supported Commands and Their Functions</summary>

- **PASS:**
  Authenticates a client by comparing the provided password with the server‚Äôs password. If incorrect, an error is returned.

- **NICK:**
  Sets or changes the client's nickname. It checks for duplicates, and if the nickname is valid and available, the client's nickname is updated. Once both NICK and USER commands are successfully executed, the welcome sequence is initiated.

- **USER:**
  Provides the username and real name necessary for client registration. This command, in conjunction with NICK, finalizes the client registration process.

- **QUIT:**
  Disconnects a client from the server, optionally with a quit message. It sends a quit reply and removes the client from the server's client list.

- **PING / PONG:**
  These commands help maintain the connection. A PING command expects a response in the form of a PONG, ensuring that both the server and client remain active.

- **JOIN:**
  Allows clients to join a channel. If the channel does not exist, it is created. The command verifies channel conditions such as invite-only status, maximum user limits, and password requirements.

- **PART:**
  Lets a client leave a channel, optionally providing a departure reason. The command ensures that the client is a member of the channel before processing the part request.

- **MODE:**
  Changes channel settings or user privileges. Supported modes include:
  - **i:** Toggle invite-only mode.
  - **l:** Set or remove a user limit.
  - **k:** Set or remove a channel password.
  - **o:** Grant or revoke operator privileges.
  - **t:** Set or remove topic restriction. When topic restriction (mode +t) is active, only the channel admin or operators can change the channel topic.

  Mode changes are broadcast to all channel members so that everyone is informed of the updated channel configuration.

- **TOPIC:**
  Allows querying or setting the topic of a channel. When issued with just the channel name, it returns the current topic (or indicates that no topic is set). When a new topic is provided (prefixed with a colon), the command verifies, if necessary, that the client has the privileges to change the topic (if the channel is topic-restricted), updates the topic, and broadcasts the change.

- **KICK:**
  Removes a user from a channel. This command checks that the requester has the necessary privileges (admin or operator) before kicking a user, and it allows specifying a reason for the kick.

- **INVITE:**
  Invites a user to a channel. The command checks that the inviter is a channel member and, for invite-only channels, that they have sufficient privileges. The invited user receives an invitation and may join the channel.

- **PRIVMSG:**
  Sends private messages to a specific user or to an entire channel. If the target is a channel, the message is broadcast to all channel members (excluding the sender); if the target is a user, the message is sent directly.

- **NOTICE:**
  Similar to PRIVMSG but designed not to generate automatic replies. It is used for sending informational messages.

- **WHO:**
  Provides a list of users on the server or in a specific channel, including details like username, hostname, and real name.

- **LIST:**
  Displays a list of channels on the server along with details such as the number of clients and the channel topic. It supports optional filtering by channel names.

<summary>üéõÔ∏è Modes and Channel Management</summary>

This IRC server supports several channel modes to provide flexible control over channel behavior:

- **Invite-Only Mode (`i`):**
  Restricts channel access to invited users only.

- **User Limit Mode (`l`):**
  Sets a maximum limit on the number of users who can join the channel.

- **Password Mode (`k`):**
  Requires a password for joining the channel.

- **Operator Mode (`o`):**
  Designates certain users as channel operators, granting them the ability to manage channel settings and user privileges.

- **Topic Restriction Mode (`t`):**
  When active, only the channel admin or operators can change the channel topic. This is enforced by the TOPIC command, which checks the topic restriction flag before allowing a topic change.

Mode changes are processed via the MODE command and immediately broadcast to all members of the channel.

### üß© How It All Comes Together

1.  **Client Connection and Registration:**
    Clients connect to the server and must first authenticate using the PASS command. They then register by setting their nickname with NICK and providing user details with USER. Once registered, a series of welcome messages (including server information and MOTD) are sent to the client.

2.  **Command Processing:**
    Each command received from a client is parsed by the `CommandHandler`, which then delegates execution to the appropriate command object. This modular approach allows for easy extension and customization of the server‚Äôs functionality.

3.  **Channel Interaction:**
    Clients can join channels, part from them, change channel modes (including topic restrictions), and interact with other users via commands such as PRIVMSG and NOTICE. Channel membership and modes are maintained by the server, and updates are broadcast to all channel members.

4.  **Graceful Shutdown and Maintenance:**
    Signal handling ensures that the server can shut down gracefully, notifying clients appropriately. Debug mode can be toggled to assist with troubleshooting.

### ü§ñ IRC Bot Assistant

This project also includes a simple IRC Bot, found in the `src/bot/` directory. This bot is designed to connect to the IRC server, join a specified channel, and interact by sending predefined messages or jokes.

You can also type in CLI and send messages manually as the bot.

**Bot Functionality:**

*   **Connection:** The bot can connect to the IRC server using a given IP address, port, nickname, channel, and password.
*   **Registration:** It handles the NICK, USER, and PASS commands for server registration.
*   **Channel Join:** After successful registration, it joins the specified channel.
*   **Ping Handling:** Responds to PING requests from the server to maintain the connection.
*   **Message Response:** When a message is detected in its channel, the bot can reply with a randomly selected joke from a predefined list.
*   **Exit Commands:** The bot can be shut down using commands like `!exit` or `!quit` sent in the channel or as a private message to the bot.

**Usage:**

1.  Navigate to the `src/bot/` directory.
2.  Compile the bot using the provided `Makefile`:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
3.  Run the bot, and follow the instructions it will provide:
    ```bash
    ./IRCBot
    ```
4.  By default it will connect to:
    ```bash
    USER: Botito
    PASS: 1234
    SERVER IP: 127.0.0.1
    SERVER PORT: 6667
    CHANNEL: #general
    ```

The bot will then attempt to connect to the server, join the channel, and start listening for messages.
